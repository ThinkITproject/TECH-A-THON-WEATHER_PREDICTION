# TECH-A-THON-WEATHER_PREDICTION

# TECH-A-THON
TECH-A-THON a Competition organized by Birla Institute of Technology (BIT-Mesra) in which we have to submit our project prototype and then the model. Through this competition BIT-Mesra has given us the opportunity to learn, build and compete among the fellow competitors. Keeping the domain ML/AI in mind we have made a project on WEATHER FORECASTING/PREDICTION.

# WEATHER_PREDICTION
Our project aims to predict the Weather conditions using the dataset with a focus on improving the accuracy of prediction. The advantages of recognising crucial elements of machine learning, such as complex data sets, play a significant role in weather forecasting. These technological strategies should be used to make people aware of natural disasters and save their lives.

Here are some of the Screenshots of our code in which we are predicting the weather condition with accuracy. The project mainly focuses on the weather prediction and help to analyse data for better feasibility. We have a classification on the issue statement. 

The datasets includes:-
1. humidity, temperature, weathertype and wind are all classified.
2. Weathertype includes overcast, rainy and sunny.
3. Mists strewn around and gloomy become mildly shady, clear as clear

Our goal is to sort the data into the four categories listed above. We must first study the facts provided to us in order to do so. We will analyze the wind type, temperature, humidity of the area and according to that our model will predict the weather suitable for play. There are a variety of approaches to train a model. It all depends on how the data is
prepped for processing. Depending on the situation, data can be used directly. Our main goal is to get the maximum accuracy from the model.

We have shown the weather Prediction using API Call also in which the model calls the API and show the description of weather of the area given in input by the user.
